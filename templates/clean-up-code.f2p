I'd like your help cleaning up and improving the code quality in this project. Please review all the code files carefully:

{{code}}

When reviewing the code, look for opportunities to improve:
- Readability and clarity 
- Adherence to language idioms and best practices
- Modularity and code organization 
- Efficiency and performance (within reason)
- Consistency in style and conventions
- Error handling and reliability
- Simplicity (remove unused code, simplify complex logic)
- Naming of variables, functions, classes, etc.
- Formatting and whitespace
- Comments and documentation 

Make sure your changes don't alter existing behavior (except perhaps for improved error handling). Try to infer the original intent as much as possible, and refactor towards that intent.

For each change you make, include a brief code comment explaining your rationale, something like:

// Refactored to improve readability and efficiency. 
// Combined error handling logic into a reusable function.

Be thoughtful and judicious with your changes. I trust your programming expertise! Let me know if any part of the original code is unclear.
